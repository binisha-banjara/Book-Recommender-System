# Book Recommender System

## Overview

This Book Recommender System is designed to provide personalized book recommendations to users based on two main approaches: Popularity-Based Recommendation and Collaborative Filtering. The system is implemented using Python and Flask, allowing users to access the recommendations through a web interface.

## Features
